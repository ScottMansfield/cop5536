COP 5536 Project 1

1) State what compiler you use, how to compile, and etc.

For development, the environment was as follows:
OS: Windows 7
IDE: Netbeans IDE version 7.3.1
Java version: 1.7.0 update 25

On the CISE machines, the package contains the build.xml used to compile the program.

From the directory that contains the build.xml file, simply type "ant" to compile
the program into a jar under the dist/ directory. In addition, the standard target
will generate the class filed in the build/ directory and javadoc for the project
in the dist/javadoc/ directory.

2) Function prototypes showing the structure of your programs.

lol

3) A summary of result comparison: You should put first your expectation of the
   comparison before running your program: i.e. what you think about the relative
   performance of each scheme, and why.

lol

4) Please include the structure of your program. List of function prototypes is not enough.

The list of packages, classes, and functions is in the answer for question 2. I
will refer to that answer in this one, where I explain the purpose of each component.

lol
